# Anthony Offor's Professional Readme 
# Description
This is the professional ReaMe of Anthony Offor, I have a background in Environmental Science and Urban Sustainability with a Masters in Environmental Science. After some time in the work force, I noticed I was not satisfied with the work I was doing as an environemtal scientist and so decided to pivote my career. So I took the University of Toronto's Coding Bootcamp where I have learnt a lot about Frontend and Backend Full Stack Web Development. If you are reading this that means you have access to my Github Portfolio, please take the time to look through my body of works and get back to me.
